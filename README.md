# Smart Rehabilitation Knee Sleeve App

A professional, data-driven rehabilitation platform developed by the **Concordia Biomedical Engineering Club (BEC)** for the **True North Biomedical Competition 2025-2026**.

---

## 🌟 Vision Statement

To create an intelligent, data-driven rehabilitation platform that transforms subjective recovery assessment into objective, measurable progress tracking through advanced EMG signal processing and machine learning algorithms.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The system operates across four integrated layers to ensure high performance and sub-50ms latency:

1.  **Hardware Layer**: ESP32-S3 microcontroller interfacing with 8-channel EMG and 9-DOF IMU sensors via BLE 5.0.
2.  **Edge Computing Layer**: Real-time signal filtering (Butterworth 20-500Hz) and feature extraction (RMS, MAV, WL, ZC) performed at the sensor level.
3.  **Mobile Application**: Cross-platform React Native app for real-time visualization, local data storage (SQLite/Redux), and on-device ML inference (TensorFlow Lite).
4.  **Cloud Backend**: Firebase infrastructure for secure authentication, clinical data sharing, and HIPAA-compliant storage.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Mobile**: React Native 0.73+ (Expo SDK 54), TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, React Navigation 6.
- **DSP**: Custom Biquad IIR filtering pipeline (Notch + Bandpass).
- **ML Engine**: TensorFlow Lite for on-device repetition counting and fatigue detection.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions).
- **UI/UX**: Custom Design System with Dark Mode support and `react-native-chart-kit`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone & Install**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Concordia-Biomedical-Engineering-Club/smart-sleeve-app.git
    cd smart-sleeve-app/smart-sleeve-app
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Environment**: Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with your Firebase credentials.
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** to test on your device.

### Running On Android Over USB

The Expo app lives in the nested `smart-sleeve-app/` folder. Run Android commands from there, not from the repository root.

1.  **Open the app directory**:
    ```bash
    cd smart-sleeve-app/smart-sleeve-app
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Verify your phone is detected over USB**:
    ```bash
    adb devices -l
    ```
    Look for your device in the output. Example:
    ```text
    R3CXB02V58B  device  usb:1-1 product:e1qcsx model:SM_S921W device:e1q
    ```
3.  **Run the app on a specific connected phone**:
    ```bash
    npx expo run:android --device "SM_S921W"
    ```
    If you have multiple devices connected, you can use the model name shown by `adb devices -l`.
4.  **If you just want the default Android target**:
    ```bash
    npx expo run:android
    ```

### Android Troubleshooting

- If `npx expo run:android` fails from the repository root with a missing `package.json` error, run it from `smart-sleeve-app/smart-sleeve-app`.
- If Gradle reports that the NDK path `27.1.12297006` is incomplete or `does not contain 'platforms'`, reinstall that NDK version:
  ```bash
  yes | "$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager" --sdk_root="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" "ndk;27.1.12297006"
  ```
- After repairing the NDK, clean and rebuild:
  ```bash
  cd smart-sleeve-app/smart-sleeve-app
  rm -rf android/.cxx android/app/.cxx android/build android/app/build
  npx expo run:android --device "SM_S921W"
  ```

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Unit Tests**: `npm test` runs 50+ cases covering signal accuracy and hardware logic.
- **Diagnostics**: Use the **Test BLE** tab to manually verify the signal processor's effect on simulated noise and motion artifacts.
